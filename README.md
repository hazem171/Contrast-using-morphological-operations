# Contrast-using-morphological-operattions

Implementing a function that can increase the contrast of a colored image using morphological operators. One way to achieve this goal is to use the following expression to increase the contrast of image I:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57532901/173256830-9d088ce5-a1a7-4022-afe5-811bfacb9bf7.png)

where I is the original image, B is the structuring element, a and b are constants, open circle indicates opening and • indicates closing. Apply your function to the image “Suez Canal.png”. 
 
Attached files:
• The output image with a square structuring element of size 3 x 3 when a = 1 and b = 1.
• The output image with a square structuring element of size 9 x 9 when a = 1 and b = 1.
• The output image with a square structuring element of size 3 x 3 when a = 5 and b = 1.
• The output image with a square structuring element of size 3 x 3 when a = 1 and b = 5.
